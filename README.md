# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is my solution following The Odin Project's curriculum. This program is a simple rock paper scissors game, in which the player chooses three options between rock, paper, and scissors, in which they face against the computer. The first to three points wins the set. This program utilized JS, CSS, and HTMl to allow user interactions with the elements. Each round shows what the computer chose and the result of the round, and there is the option to continuously replay the game. 

The main difficulty found while programming this project was getting familiar with the utility of DOM elements and combining JS with HTML and CSS, as this was the first project where I had experienced al three of them together. 

In the future, I hope to refine the UI in a way that makes the game more aesthetically pleasing.
